# Overview
> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. ~ https://graphql.org/

* Supports reading, writing (mutating) and subscribing to changes to data (realtime updates)
* Clients access one server endpoint
* Server supports any type or number of data sources
  * Aggregating many endpoints as a single interface is a popular usage
* HTTP based protocol
* Numerous implementations, including most languages
