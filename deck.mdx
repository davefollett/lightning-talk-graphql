# GraphQL

A query language for your API.

âš¡ TALK - 17 APR 2019 - DAVE FOLLETT

---

# Overview
> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. ~ https://graphql.org/

* Supports reading, writing (mutating) and subscribing to changes to data (realtime updates)
* Clients access one server endpoint
* Server supports any type or number of data sources
  * Aggregating many endpoints as a single interface is a popular usage
* HTTP based protocol
* Numerous implementations, including most languages

<Notes>
    <h3>Key Points</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>GraphQL elimates under and over fetching</li>
    </ul>

# Example Query #1

<Split>

```
// Query
{
  allPeople(first:2) {
    people {
      name
      homeworld {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
// Query Results
{
  "data": {
    "allPeople": {
      "people": [
        {
          "name": "Luke Skywalker",
          "homeworld": {
            "name": "Tatooine"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "C-3PO",
          "homeworld": {
            "name": "Tatooine"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</Split>

<Notes>
    <h3>Key Points</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Client query shown on the left</li>
        <li>Server response shown on the right</li>
        <li>Server responds using the same structure as the client query</li>
        <li>Limit 2 only results the 1st two results, so it fits on the slide</li>
    </ul>
</Notes>

# Example Query #2

<Split>

```
// Query
{
  person(id: "cGVvcGxlOjg2") {
    id
    name
    hairColor
    eyeColor
  }
}
```

```
// Query Results
{
  "data": {
    "person": {
      "id": "cGVvcGxlOjg2",
      "name": "Poe Dameron",
      "hairColor": "brown",
      "eyeColor": "brown"
    }
  }
}
```
</Split>

<Notes>
    <h3>Key Points</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Client query shown on the left, specifying the id</li>
        <li>Server response shown on the right</li>
        <li>Server responds using the same structure as the client query</li>
    </ul>
